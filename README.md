COURSE DESCRIPTION
Formulating a sound competitive strategy and   achieving   growth across multiple,   different business            units to sustain long-term superior performance are two of   the   critical tasks   for   general managers   to         ensure the success of   the firms they lead. The objective   of   this   course is   to provide   students   with   an         opportunity to understand, through analytical approaches and critical thinking, how companies make   strategic decisions to support the development of   competitive advantages, corporate   growth   and   shareholder value through the simultaneous pursuit of   economic as well as social   and   ecological   performance dimensions. We will focus on strategic issues   from the viewpoint   of   senior management in both domestic and international corporations. Through a combination   of   lectures,   readings, case studies, experiential exercises and a   consultancy project,   this   course   introduces students to the tools and knowledge required for critical and   effective   strategic   analysis, thinking,   and application. Mastery of these tools and knowledge has relevance to everyone   seeking   a   career in   strategy   as   a   manager, an   entrepreneur,   or   a   consultant.
The course will help students develop a general management point   of   view and   appreciate   strategy   to   the   firm's   overall   growth   and   welfare. You   will   learn   how   to   analyze   the   firm,   and   its environment, and then align strategies to the firm’s revenue   and profitability   goals.You will work in teams on selected companies to produce a   final   consultancy project.   This   course      will require hard work and thinking, augmented by your creativity, to produce a   fun   and   enriching   experience.

LEARNING   ENVIRONMENT
A willingness to attend, prepare classes in advance, and participate actively   is   the   central   ingredient   for succeeding in this course. A few essential points   concerning   our   classes:
a.    You   must   prepare   each   class   (both   lectures   and   tutorials)   in   advance.   We   plan   to   be
prepared for every class and we expect you to   do the   same.   Before   each   class   (both   lecture   and            tutorial formats), get informed on what you are   supposed to   do. Your   diligent work prior to   class   is essential for achieving our   learning   objectives.
b.    Attendance   is   mandatory.   If   you   must   miss   a   class, we   expect   you   to   notify   your   instructor   by email in   advance.
c.    Classes   start   on   time.   We   do   arrive   punctually   to   class,   and   we   expect   you   to   do   the   same.
d.    Electronic devices.   Use of   electronic devices in class is not   allowed   except   in   answering poll   questions during class and taking   notes.
e.    Regularly check your SKEMA emailbox   for   communications   and updates.

your   own   teams   by   a   pre-assigned   deadline. Otherwise, you   will   be   randomly   assigned   to   a   team by the instructor before the first tutorial session. The teams’ composition   cannot be   changed.
g.    Free   riding   will   be   sanctioned. We   expect   you   to   remain   engaged   and   contribute   to   the   team
assignments throughout the course. Your instructor reserves the right to apply grade penalties to   sanction free riding.
PEDAGOGICAL   APPROACH
We   will   use   a   combination   of   (a) theory   and   (b)   a   team   project.
a.    Lectures (CMs) will introduce theoretical and conceptual   frameworks   for   strategic   management   and showcase different real-world applications, which will help analyze strategic   problems   and develop solutions to deal with these   situations.
•          Theory-focused sessions are designed to   present   and   explain   relevant   theoretical   frameworks.
•          Case-focused sessions show   application   cases   on   different   industry   and   company   situations and support your learning and understanding with a strategy
conversation   of   the   week, i.e., a   debate   on   the   case   of   an   industry   or   the   strategy   of a   company.
b.    Tutorials   (TDs) are   meant   to   help   you   become   familiar   with   the   role   of   strategic   analysts   and consultants. The project will simulate a consultancy assignment.   In teams   of   maximum   five members, you   will   work   on   a   company   at   your   choice   among   a   pre-selected   set,   collect,   and quantitatively analyze information about the company’s strategy from   available   sources,   and prepare and verbally present   two PowerPoint consultancy presentations (mid-term and   final)   based   on   the   results   of   your   analyses, covering   the   following   aspects:   (a) the   company’s   external environment   (i.e., industry   analysis) (mid-term),   (b) its   business   strategy   (mid-term),   (c)   its   resources   and   capabilities   (mid-term); and   (d) the   company’s   corporate   strategy   (final); and   (e)         final evidence-based recommendations (final). The presentations will be worked will be worked   and verbally presented during the tutorial sessions (refer to the outline below). Details   about the   deadlines   will   be   announced   during   the   course   on   the   K2 platform.
